## Overview

Recognizing and quantifying viral variants from wastewater requires expert human judgment in the final steps.
V-Pipe Scout allows for rapid exploration of wastewater viral sequences down to the single read level. 

Its aim: Discover novel viral threats a few weeks earlier than traditional methods.

This Proof-of-Concept is set up for SARS-CoV-2, yet is built to be virus-agnostic and will be expanded to RSV and Influenza soon.

This is an effort of the V-Pipe team.
For more information about V-Pipe, visit the [V-Pipe website](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/V-pipe/).

</div>

Specifically, V-Pipe Scout enables:
- **Exploration of mutations at the read level**  
    - For known resistance mutations  
    - Guided by smart filters and variant signatures
- **Composition of variant signatures for abundance estimates**  
    - Leveraging clinical sequence databases (e.g., [CovSpectrum](https://cov-spectrum.org/))  
    - Using curated variant signatures

Further, we will implement:
- On-demand variant abundance estimates by [Lollipop](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/LolliPop)

V-Pipe Scout brings together:
- [V-pipe](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/V-pipe) - our prime Wastewater Viral Analysis Pipeline, see [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.16.562462v1.full). 
- [GenSpectrum](https://genspectrum.org/) - in particular the novel fast database for genomic sequences [LAPIS-SILO](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO), see [publication](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-023-05364-3)


This application relies on two other repos as connecting infrastructure:
- [WisePulse](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/WisePulse) - to pre-process and run the SILO database, powering read-level queries
- [sr2silo](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/sr2silo) - large scale data-wrangler of nucleotide alignments, to amino-acids and SILO input format


## Deployment

The current deployment of this project can be accessed at [dev.vpipe.ethz.ch](http://dev.vpipe.ethz.ch).
_Only accessible within ETH Zürich Networks._

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cbg-ethz/v-pipe-scout.git
    cd v-pipe-scout
    ```

2. Configure the Wise Loculus to LAPIS APIs for clinical and wastewater data in `app/config.yaml` including ports:
    ```yaml
    server:
      lapis_address: "http://88.198.54.174:80"
      cov_sprectrum_api: "https://lapis.cov-spectrum.org"
    ```

3. Run the application using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### Architecture Overview

The application is built using a microservices architecture managed by Docker Compose. The key components include:

- **Streamlit Frontend**: A web application for interactive exploration of viral variants.
- **Celery Worker**: Handles background tasks such as deconvolution and data processing.
- **Redis**: Acts as both the message broker and result backend for Celery.

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates these services, ensuring seamless communication between components.
